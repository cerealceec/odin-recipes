        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the grated zucchini, sugar, brown sugar, applesauce, oil, eggs, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir just until no dry flour remains, trying not to over mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Bake for 50 to 54 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the bread should come out with moist crumbs on it.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
            <li>Store covered in the refrigerator. *This bread is best served after it has been refrigerated for at least 12 hours.</li>
